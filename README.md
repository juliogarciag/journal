## Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Go to `server`, copy `.env.example` into `.env` and configure environment
   variables as you see fit.
3. Go to the `client` folder and run `yarn`.
4. Go to the `server` folder and run `yarn`.

## Run

Run `heroku local`, which it's the same as going to both folders to run
`yarn start` on them.
